# DDoS Attack Map

A student-built DDoS Attack Map that demonstrates real-time visualization of global attack telemetry.  
It fetches free-tier data from **Cloudflare Radar** and **AbuseIPDB**, classifies malicious IPs using lightweight machine learning, geolocates them, and renders live attack flows on a 3D globe frontend.  
The backend is powered by **FastAPI**, while the frontend uses **React + deck.gl + MapLibre**.
